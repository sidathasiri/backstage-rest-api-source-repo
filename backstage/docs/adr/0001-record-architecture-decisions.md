# ADR 0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to record the architectural decisions made during the development of our software system. This helps current and future contributors understand the rationale behind these decisions and improves knowledge sharing and maintainability.

## Decision
We will adopt the **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** pattern proposed by Michael Nygard. Each decision will be written in a separate markdown file under the `docs/adr/` directory in the repository. Files will be named sequentially (e.g., `0001`, `0002`, etc.) to maintain ordering.

We will also enable the **Backstage ADR plugin** to visualize and manage ADRs in our Backstage developer portal.

## Consequences
- Developers will document key architectural decisions using markdown files.
- The ADRs will be visible through Backstage under the ADR tab for each component.
- We will enforce ADR creation for major decisions via pull request templates or architectural review checklists.
